    I'll start with a short video that shows a few of examples of exoskeletons
    that have been developed to help people with spinal cord injuries walk with
    mechanical assistance. These types of devices are remarkable in that they
    allow a paralyzed person to take steps again, but there is still a lot of
    work to be done to provide both natural gait and balance. We are interested
    in identifying control schemes used by able-bodied walkers and mapping
    those to the CPU, sensor and actuator network inside these powered
    exoskeletons.

    <!--
    We start by modeling the human during cyclic walking as a
    multi-input/output feeback system. The human plant is driven by joint
    torques and can be perturbed by external inputs. The state is sensed, the
    kinematics in our case, and subtracted from a nominal or open loop solution
    to cyclic gait. The controller then computes the additive inputs to the
    nominal or open loop joint torques to drive the walker back to the nominal
    cyclic walking pattern.

    We approach the identification of the controller from a direct

    estimates of the joint angles, rates, and torques throughout the phase of
    the gait cycle, phi. To ensure that feedback control is used, we perturb
    the plant (the human) with random external perturbations, which are also
    measured. Our goal being to find a feedback gain matrix that relates the
    sensor error to the plant inputs.

      <h2>Closed Loop System Identification</h2>
      <p>Closed loop system id is possible, but one must be aware of several
      issues. There are three common methods:</p>

        <li>Direct Approach</li>
        <li>Indirect Approach</li>
        <li>Joint Input-Output Approach</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the direct method is used the external perturbations must be high
      enough to bias the identification towards the controller, rather than the
      inverse of the plant. (Kearny 1990, van der Kooij 2005)</p>

    Since we can't measure the nomimal joint kinematics or joint torques we can
    use a little equation rearranging to put the equation in a form that
    relates inputs to the controller to its outputs into a form that makes it
    linear in the gains and a term I will call m*, which equals the nominal
    torque if feedback is zero. This form can generalize to any number and type
    of sensors and control inputs.

    From now on I'll use a simplified controller model. The idea is to try to
    extract a controller for sensors and control inputs available on an exoskeleton
    from data collected from an able bodied human. So we formulate a simple
    2D PD controller that feeds back angle and rate at the ankle, knee, and hip

    This plot shows the joint torques in each joint and each leg, both the
